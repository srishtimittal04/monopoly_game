Design Aspects :
Application is built on spring-boot mvc architecture.

Entity package contains entity classes : Places and Players to persist data in database.

Repository package contains repository interface which extends JpaRepository to handle all crud operations. It is like abstration of dao layer.

Controller package contains API to start game and handle moves.

MonopolyApplication enables all spring-boot configuration. This is point for intialization of web application.


Assumptions:
"Pall Mall" is designated as "start". Player crossing this will gain $200 amount.

With H2 configuration, db state will not be maintained. On stopping the service player cannot continue his previous game.

Game can be played with 1 or 2 player depending on what API we send. There is no validation to check if dice is rolled by alternate players.
